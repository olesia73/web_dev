## Gallery Site

Review the NYC Gallery folder and see how the style.css page is setup.

Download the Gallery Starter File and add it to your GitHub page (username.github.io repository).

Style the gallery in your own way.

> Examples:
>
> - Add your own images
> - Different font
> - Change the colors and background images

Anything you want to change, as long it utilizes what we learned in class.

Be creative and have fun!
