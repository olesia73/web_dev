# Easter Event Page
## Logo
## Events
## Calendar
with date buttons




# JS Code
**var** current_week (so we display that week in the calendar)\
**function** highlight_dates_with_events_and_link_them_to_the_event_pages (working title)\
**function** open_event() - loads the event page at the bottom half, updates background & styling for the whole page (now you know where most of our library's budget goes to (as in "creating more jobs for the Americans))

```js
var did_not_do_much;
