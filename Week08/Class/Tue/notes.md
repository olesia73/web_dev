wrapper tag's overflow auto for the device understanding overflow when changing size (on spot too)

## Flexbox
div container + div items\
its props: flex-sth\
.flex-container > div is the syntax for items\
direction: row, column, reverse of either (3, 2, 1)\
wrap: no, normal, reverse (for rows/cols, not items within a row)\
nowrap is the **sad** default\
**nowrap is sad**\
flow = direction + wrap\
justify-content is to align within the container\
*horizontal*\
(space-align is the most intuitive one)\
align-items is for aligning vertically\
"align-items: stretch" for looooong\
": baseline" can make weird (if sizings for each are different)\
so align-items trumps subsizing\
center for both to make it boring\
