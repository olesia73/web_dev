# Websites
## [Razom NGO](https://www.razomforukraine.org)
Navigation bar just disappears if you scroll down, which is not cool because the page is so looong
## [NYU Login Page](https://shibboleth.nyu.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e2s1)
Possibly the worst? It always gives the error on my first login and keeps asking whether my devices are my devices. It's not bad in terms of what we've covered in class, I just took advantage of this opportunity to complain
## [Duolingo](https://uk.duolingo.com)
Although language option is featured in the navigation bar, good luck figuring out what to click if you opened the site in a different language & script
