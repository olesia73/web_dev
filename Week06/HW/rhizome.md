I chose [Grobari](https://anthology.rhizome.org/grobari) because it means Undertakers in my mother tongue. Apparently, that's the word we share with Serbians. And other ex-Yugoslavians. All of those people to whom no longer existing domain .yu used to belong. These two letters outlived the country they used to represent by almost twenty years. At first symbolizing tremendous effort of Yugoslavian scientists to connect this borderline of the Iron Curtain to the rest of the world, .yu eventually turned into outdated paperwork to deal with. As the cranky lady from the documentary pointed out, .yu was an opportunity. And Montenegro took it. The last among six Yugoslavia's descendants' domains to be issued, Montenegrin one also promises to be the most lucrative one: Montenegro went from .yu to .me.

At first, it might seem unrelated to "The Undertakers". Would it help if I mentioned that [Grobari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grobari) is a football fan group? A Serbian one, at that. Grey fumes can be seen if you borderless-print and stack thousand of pages the artist had provided in pdf. If only those rose from eternal flame. Fire in this artwork resulted from hooliganism Grobari were known for back in the days of Yugoslavian wars. Shortly after even Yugoslavia's web trace was extinguished, one more person was killed by Grobari. The country's violence outlived the country.
